# Cannabis Stock Prices and Media Hype
## Deep Learning Projecting Utilizing NLTK and Time Series Analysis

This project focuses on four major cannabis stocks: Tilray, Inc. (TLRY), Canopy Growth Corporation (CGC), Aurora Cannabis, Inc (ACB), and Cronos Group (CRON), and the effects media hype has had on their stock price fluctuations.

First, I will scrape the stock prices and store them in Pandas dataframes. Then, I will perform time series analyses on each stock. Next, I will scrape popular financial articles mentioning the stocks and classify the sentiments as positive or negative using NLTK. Finally, I will overlay the dates of the articles over a visualization of the stock prices and test for correlation between the articles' sentiments and the flucuations of the stock prices.
